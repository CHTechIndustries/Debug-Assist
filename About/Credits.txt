Also, an extra big thank you to Discord user erdelf (steam: https://steamcommunity.com/id/erdelf/ ). There was a major, major error, that was caused by a very subtle misclick. I could never have found it, but he did, (mostly because rimworld seemed to be fine with "this shit" except for that one error, and he just had to see why! Still not sure if I should take his wording as an insult or compliment... so, I'll take it as a compliment) (when someone asked if he read it, he said, to quite him, "this shit passes xml validation.. so I had to")
