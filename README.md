# Debug-Assist
This mod "encurages" a certain load order. Combined with RymPy's "sorting rules", you can make your mods stay bellow it, and ones that are soft dependencies above, to fully seperate them. Might one day also provide features, but untill then...

If you don't want any of the mods, just edit the about file. You can make a fork of this mod with the edit, or whatever. It's open source!
